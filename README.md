This is a practice project on datacamp.

The climate is changing around the world. The impacts of climate change are felt in many different areas, but they are particularly noticeable in their effects on birds. Many bird species are moving north, if they can, to stay in climatic conditions that are suitable for them.

Our analysis will use data from the UK Met Office together with records from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to build our very own species distribution model using machine learning. This model will be able to predict where our bird species of interest is likely to occur in the future - information that is invaluable to conservation organization working on the ground to preserve these species and save them from extinction!
